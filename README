DESCRIPTION
This plugin automatically persists (parts of) certain buffers when Vim is done
editing the buffer, regardless of whether is was saved to a file or discarded.
In this way, this is related to the built-in persistent-undo functionality,
but rather meant for building a history of file contents to allow browsing and
recall, especially for things like commit messages, where Vim is invoked as
the editor from an external tool.

SEE ALSO
This plugin is used by:
MessageRecall (vimscript #4116): Browse and re-insert previous (commit,
                                 status) messages.

USAGE
The plugin is completely inactive until you set it up for a particular
buffer through the following function; you'll find the details directly in the
.vim/autoload/BufferPersist.vim implementation file.

BufferPersist#Setup( BufferStoreFuncref, ... )


EXAMPLE
Let's store the first three lines of each edited text file in the temp
directory, using the text file's filename prefixed with "preview-":
    function! BufferStore( bufNr )
        return $TEMP . '/preview-' . fnamemodify(bufname(a:bufNr), ':t')
    endfunction
    autocmd BufNew,BufRead *.txt call BufferPersist#Setup(
    \   function('BufferStore'),
    \   {'range': '1,3'}
    \)
